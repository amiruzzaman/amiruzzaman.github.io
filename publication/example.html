  abstract={We proposed a new but simple and efficient merge sort technique. This method has several advantages on performance over previous merge sort technique. This technique divides the whole data as like divided and conquer method but until two elements in a group instead of one in each group like traditional merge sort by [D. E. Knuth (1973)]. Then solves the divided parts and conquers them. The resulting efficiency of this method is that the division of problem is much less then the previous method, so the recursive call is also less. As a result we have less comparison and less computational time.},

Also, the contributing factors that may cause more damages (e.g., personal injury, property damage, etc.) are discussed in this paper. The national database for traffic-violation was considered for the mining and analyzed results indicated that a few specific times are probable for traffic-violations. Moreover, most accidents happened on specific days and times. The findings of this work could help prevent some traffic-violations or reduce the chance of occurrence. These results can be used to increase cautions and traffic-safety tips.",

    abstract={This paper introduces a new steganographic technique in which a set of concurrent hidden channels are established between a sender and multiple receivers. Each channel is protected by a separate key. The method can work with JPEG blocks in which an 8{\texttimes}8 block is divided into four non-overlapping sets, each consisting a covert channel that hides a single bit of information. A receiver can decode its independent hidden data using its dedicated key. The distortion of the covert channel data is controlled by minimizing the round-off error of the JPEG image. The method tries to keep the coefficients of the original histogram intact while carrying hidden bits. The method is immune against first order statistical detection.},

Results also suggest that most accidents occurred in October, which is a popular month for tourism.

    abstract = {Abstract Data containing geospatial semantics, such as geotagged tweets, travel blogs, and crime reports, associates natural language texts with geographical locations. This paper presents a lens-based visual interaction technique, GTMapLens, to flexibly browse the geo-text data on a map. It allows users to perform dynamic focus+context exploration by using movable lenses to browse geographical regions, find locations of interest, and perform comparative and drill-down studies. Geo-text data is visualized in a way that users can easily perceive the underlying geospatial semantics along with lens moving. Based on a requirement analysis with a cohort of multidisciplinary domain experts, a set of lens interaction techniques are developed including keywords control, path management, context visualization, and snapshot anchors. They allow users to achieve a guided and controllable exploration of geo-text data. A hierarchical data model enables the interactive lens operations by accelerated data retrieval from a geo-text database. Evaluation with real-world datasets is presented to show the usability and effectiveness of GTMapLens.},

This method separates the selective and non-selective blocks first, selects the selective blocks next, and shifts the position of last non-zero AC coefficients to embed secret messages. Even after hiding data, non-zero JPEG coefficients remain unchanged. Since this method does not change the AC coefficients, but changes their positions, the produced histogram of the image after data hiding remains the same as that of original image.},

Among all image hash functions, a histogram-based method shows better robustness to common signal processing operations and various geometric attacks. In this paper, performance of this method is improved by utilizing histogram generation method. Histogram with equal population improves the performance slightly. In order to compare performance of image hash generation functions, a statistical tool is provided. The proposed tool will help to evaluate the performance of image hash generator functions.},
