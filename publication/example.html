  abstract={We proposed a new but simple and efficient merge sort technique. This method has several advantages on performance over previous merge sort technique. This technique divides the whole data as like divided and conquer method but until two elements in a group instead of one in each group like traditional merge sort by [D. E. Knuth (1973)]. Then solves the divided parts and conquers them. The resulting efficiency of this method is that the division of problem is much less then the previous method, so the recursive call is also less. As a result we have less comparison and less computational time.},

abstract = {Abstract Data containing geospatial semantics, such as geotagged tweets, travel blogs, and crime reports, associates natural language texts with geographical locations. This paper presents a lens-based visual interaction technique, GTMapLens, to flexibly browse the geo-text data on a map. It allows users to perform dynamic focus+context exploration by using movable lenses to browse geographical regions, find locations of interest, and perform comparative and drill-down studies. Geo-text data is visualized in a way that users can easily perceive the underlying geospatial semantics along with lens moving. Based on a requirement analysis with a cohort of multidisciplinary domain experts, a set of lens interaction techniques are developed including keywords control, path management, context visualization, and snapshot anchors. They allow users to achieve a guided and controllable exploration of geo-text data. A hierarchical data model enables the interactive lens operations by accelerated data retrieval from a geo-text database. Evaluation with real-world datasets is presented to show the usability and effectiveness of GTMapLens.},

abstract={This paper introduces a new steganographic technique in which a set of concurrent hidden channels are established between a sender and multiple receivers. Each channel is protected by a separate key. The method can work with JPEG blocks in which an 8{\texttimes}8 block is divided into four non-overlapping sets, each consisting a covert channel that hides a single bit of information. A receiver can decode its independent hidden data using its dedicated key. The distortion of the covert channel data is controlled by minimizing the round-off error of the JPEG image. The method tries to keep the coefficients of the original histogram intact while carrying hidden bits. The method is immune against first order statistical detection.},

  abstract={This paper presents a new application for multidimensional Skyline query. The idea presented in this paper can be used to find best shopping malls based on users requirements. A web-based application was used to simulate the problem and proposed solution. Also, a mathematical definition was developed to define the problem and show how multi-dimensional Skyline query can be used to solve complex problems, such as, finding shopping malls using multiple different criteria. The idea of this paper can be used in other fields, where different criteria should be considered.},

abstract="In this study, we present both data mining and information visualization techniques to identify accident-prone areas, most accident-prone time, day, and month. Also, we surveyed among volunteers to understand which visualization techniques help non-expert users to understand the findings better. Findings of this study suggest that most accidents occur in the dusk (i.e., between 6 and 7 pm), and on Fridays. Results also suggest that most accidents occurred in October, which is a popular month for tourism. These findings are consistent with social information and can help policymakers, residents, tourists, and other law enforcement agencies. This study can be extended to draw broader implications.",
