Many researches have been done in this area most of which are image or pattern-based analysis. The accuracy level depends on the quality of the image or pattern. In this paper, we proposed user authentication system using an individual's pen tablet handwriting data. The proposed system is concerned with the numerical value of a person handwriting data getting from the digital pen and tablet device. Hence, user authentication through pen tablet data ensures more accuracy by working with user's real time handwritten data. In the proposed system, 24 persons writing samples(1262 .csv files and 23 class)are used for extracting features to identify a user based on their handwriting attributes. Six completely separated features are extracted after data analysis and pre-processing. The extracted features are mainly concerned with the vital attributes of a user's handwriting. The extracted features are used for classification. With this concern, we utilized different classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Random Forest (RF) classifier. From the implementation, different algorithms show different accuracy level. The testing accuracy rate of SVM, LR, LDA and RF is 87%, 85%, 76% and 77% respectively.

The recognition of human activities, commonly known as HAR can play a vital task in this regard. HAR has an appealing use in the health-care system and monitoring of Daily Living Activities (DLA) of elderly people by offering the input for the development of more interactive and cognitive environments. This paper is presenting a model for the recognition of Human Activities. In this proposed model, the Enveloped Power Spectrum (EPS) is used for extracting impulse components of the signal, and the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used as a dimensionality reduction procedure to extract the discriminant features for human daily activity recognition. After completing EPS feature extraction techniques, LDA is performed on those extracted spectra for extracting features using the dimension reduction technique. Finally, the discriminant vocabulary vector is trained by the Multiclass Support Vector Machine (MCSVM) to classify human activities.

Using the computer-aided system, the efficient and early detection of smoke may stop a massive fire incident. Without considering the multiple moving objects on background and smoke particles analysis (i.e., pattern recognition), smoke detection models show suboptimal performance. To address this, this paper proposes a hybrid smoke segmentation and an efficient symmetrical simulation model of dynamic smoke to extract a smoke growth feature based on temporal frames from a video. In this model, smoke is segmented from the multi-moving object on the complex background using the Gaussian&rsquo;s Mixture Model (GMM) and HSV (hue-saturation-value) color segmentation to encounter the candidate smoke and non-smoke regions in the preprocessing stage. The preprocessed temporal frames with moving smoke are analyzed by the dynamic smoke growth analysis and spatial-temporal frame energy feature extraction model. In dynamic smoke growth analysis, the temporal frames are segmented in blocks and the smoke growth representations are formulated from corresponding blocks. Finally, the classifier was trained using the extracted features to classify and detect smoke using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) non-linear Gaussian kernel-based binary Support Vector Machine (SVM). For validating the proposed smoke detection model, multi-conditional video clips are used.

A receiver can decode its independent hidden data using its dedicated key. The distortion of the covert channel data is controlled by minimizing the round-off error of the JPEG image.

The visual study is seamlessly integrated with the geographical environment by combining DL model performance with geospatial visualization techniques. Model performance measures can be studied together with a set of geospatial attributes over map views. Users can also discover and compare prediction behaviors of multiple DL models in both city-wide and street-level analysis, together with road images and video contents. Therefore, the system provides a new visual exploration platform for DL model designers in autonomous driving.

Data-driven visualizations have yet to be fully incorporated into the flight training process. The Airman Visual Evaluation System (AVES) applies a data-driven approach to support airman certification training by processing data recorded from common avionics systems such as the Garmin G1000. Maneuvers, e.g. steep turns, are decomposed into a hierarchical definition including task, sub-task, and related components according to available data. Each level in the hierarchy defines a related event detectable within the data. At the top-level of the hierarchy are points where an instructor may wish to review with a student while lower levels of the hierarchy support the review with additional information. Performance measurements are associated with each event to be captured from the data. Visual analytics approaches are applied to convey the events and related performance information including 2D and 3D views of flight replay, event timelines, performance related visualizations. The visualizations are provided in an interactive application to convey the information. User studies are conducted to identify and measure value within airman certification programs.
