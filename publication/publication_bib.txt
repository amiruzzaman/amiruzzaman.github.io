Findings of this study suggest that most accidents occur in the dusk (i.e., between 6 and 7 pm), and on Fridays. Results also suggest that most accidents occurred in October, which is a popular month for tourism. These findings are consistent with social information and can help policymakers, residents, tourists, and other law enforcement agencies. This study can be extended to draw broader implications.",

  abstract={Identifying a user or a person through handwriting-data is a popular technique. Many researches have been done in this area most of which are image or pattern-based analysis. The accuracy level depends on the quality of the image or pattern. In this paper, we proposed user authentication system using an individual's pen tablet handwriting data. The proposed system is concerned with the numerical value of a person handwriting data getting from the digital pen and tablet device. Hence, user authentication through pen tablet data ensures more accuracy by working with user's real time handwritten data. In the proposed system, 24 persons writing samples(1262 .csv files and 23 class)are used for extracting features to identify a user based on their handwriting attributes. Six completely separated features are extracted after data analysis and pre-processing. The extracted features are mainly concerned with the vital attributes of a user's handwriting. The extracted features are used for classification. With this concern, we utilized different classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Random Forest (RF) classifier. From the implementation, different algorithms show different accuracy level. The testing accuracy rate of SVM, LR, LDA and RF is 87%, 85%, 76% and 77% respectively. The experimental analysis shows that we got more robust and satisfactory results which ensure the practicality of our system.},

  abstract={Activity identification based on machine learning for human computing aims to understand or capture the state of human behavior, its environment, and integrate user by exploiting distinct types of sensors to give adjustment to the exogenous computing system. The ascent of universal computing systems requires our environment a solid requirement for novel methodologies of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). The recognition of human activities, commonly known as HAR can play a vital task in this regard. HAR has an appealing use in the health-care system and monitoring of Daily Living Activities (DLA) of elderly people by offering the input for the development of more interactive and cognitive environments. This paper is presenting a model for the recognition of Human Activities. In this proposed model, the Enveloped Power Spectrum (EPS) is used for extracting impulse components of the signal, and the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used as a dimensionality reduction procedure to extract the discriminant features for human daily activity recognition. After completing EPS feature extraction techniques, LDA is performed on those extracted spectra for extracting features using the dimension reduction technique. Finally, the discriminant vocabulary vector is trained by the Multiclass Support Vector Machine (MCSVM) to classify human activities. For validating the proposed scheme, UCI-HAR datasets have been implemented which demonstrates higher recognition accuracy which has been acknowledged.},

ABSTRACT = {This article concerns smoke detection in the early stages of a fire. Using the computer-aided system, the efficient and early detection of smoke may stop a massive fire incident. Without considering the multiple moving objects on background and smoke particles analysis (i.e., pattern recognition), smoke detection models show suboptimal performance. To address this, this paper proposes a hybrid smoke segmentation and an efficient symmetrical simulation model of dynamic smoke to extract a smoke growth feature based on temporal frames from a video. In this model, smoke is segmented from the multi-moving object on the complex background using the Gaussian&rsquo;s Mixture Model (GMM) and HSV (hue-saturation-value) color segmentation to encounter the candidate smoke and non-smoke regions in the preprocessing stage. The preprocessed temporal frames with moving smoke are analyzed by the dynamic smoke growth analysis and spatial-temporal frame energy feature extraction model. In dynamic smoke growth analysis, the temporal frames are segmented in blocks and the smoke growth representations are formulated from corresponding blocks. Finally, the classifier was trained using the extracted features to classify and detect smoke using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) non-linear Gaussian kernel-based binary Support Vector Machine (SVM). For validating the proposed smoke detection model, multi-conditional video clips are used. The experimental results suggest that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using embedded sensors in smartphones and smartwatch has gained popularity in extensive applications in health care monitoring of elderly people, security purpose, robotics, monitoring employees in the industry, and others. However, human behavior analysis using the accelerometer and gyroscope data are typically grounded on supervised classification techniques, where models are showing sub-optimal performance for qualitative and quantitative features. Considering this factor, this paper proposes an efficient and reduce dimension feature extraction model for human activity recognition. In this feature extraction technique, the Enveloped Power Spectrum (EPS) is used for extracting impulse components of the signal using frequency domain analysis which is more robust and noise insensitive. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used as dimensionality reduction procedure to extract the minimum number of discriminant features from envelop spectrum for human activity recognition (HAR). The extracted features are used for human activity recognition using Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MCSVM). The proposed model was evaluated by using two benchmark datasets, i.e., the UCI-HAR and DU-MD datasets. This model is compared with other state-of-the-art methods and the model is outperformed.},

This paper presents a lens-based visual interaction technique, GTMapLens, to flexibly browse the geo-text data on a map. It allows users to perform dynamic focus+context exploration by using movable lenses to browse geographical regions, find locations of interest, and perform comparative and drill-down studies. Geo-text data is visualized in a way that users can easily perceive the underlying geospatial semantics along with lens moving. Based on a requirement analysis with a cohort of multidisciplinary domain experts, a set of lens interaction techniques are developed including keywords control, path management, context visualization, and snapshot anchors. They allow users to achieve a guided and controllable exploration of geo-text data. A hierarchical data model enables the interactive lens operations by accelerated data retrieval from a geo-text database. Evaluation with real-world datasets is presented to show the usability and effectiveness of GTMapLens.},

  abstract={Vision-based deep learning (DL) methods have made great progress in learning autonomous driving models from large-scale crowd-sourced video datasets. They are trained to predict instantaneous driving behaviors from video data captured by on-vehicle cameras. In this paper, we develop a geo-context aware visualization system for the study of Autonomous Driving Model (ADM) predictions together with large-scale ADM video data. The visual study is seamlessly integrated with the geographical environment by combining DL model performance with geospatial visualization techniques. Model performance measures can be studied together with a set of geospatial attributes over map views. Users can also discover and compare prediction behaviors of multiple DL models in both city-wide and street-level analysis, together with road images and video contents. Therefore, the system provides a new visual exploration platform for DL model designers in autonomous driving. Use cases and domain expert evaluation show the utility and effectiveness of the visualization system.},

  abstract={DBSCAN is a well-known clustering algorithm that is often used to find associations and structures in large spatial data. Due to its popularity, built-in functions for DBSCAN have been implemented on top of many different programming languages. Researchers and practitioners (i.e., data scientists) have been using these built-in functions to cluster and analyze a prolific area of research in data science. Due to the many implementations of DBSCAN and its utilization in many different languages, the output of each built-in DBSCAN function is assumed to be identical. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to evaluate the built-in functions of DBSCAN algorithms and to identify discrepancies in their output. The evidence from the study shows that there are some discrepancies and recommends caution in dealing with built-in functions.},

  abstract={Supply chains in the modern era have developed into very complex value networks and have become a critical source of competitive advantage. Verifying the origin of raw materials and maintaining visibility of goods and merchandise as they move through the value chain network is difficult. The Internet of Things (IoT) application may assist businesses in observing, tracking, and monitoring items, activities, and processes inside their value chain networks. Both blockchain and Internet of Things technologies have the potential to accelerate the implementation of Industry 4.0 and transform foreign trade procedures. Integrated technology utilization may be a component of the answer to this future. This paper’s contribution is to demonstrate how the marriage of Blockchain technology with IoT infrastructure may simplify and enhance contemporary supply chains in a variety of ways. Such as increasing scalability, security, immutability, and auditing, as well as information flows, traceability, and interoperability, and quality, using Ping Asset devices and Chainlink, and so setting the groundwork for future research projects.},

Data-driven visualizations have yet to be fully incorporated into the flight training process. The Airman Visual Evaluation System (AVES) applies a data-driven approach to support airman certification training by processing data recorded from common avionics systems such as the Garmin G1000. Maneuvers, e.g. steep turns, are decomposed into a hierarchical definition including task, sub-task, and related components according to available data. Each level in the hierarchy defines a related event detectable within the data. At the top-level of the hierarchy are points where an instructor may wish to review with a student while lower levels of the hierarchy support the review with additional information. Performance measurements are associated with each event to be captured from the data. Visual analytics approaches are applied to convey the events and related performance information including 2D and 3D views of flight replay, event timelines, performance related visualizations. The visualizations are provided in an interactive application to convey the information. User studies are conducted to identify and measure value within airman certification programs. }

ABSTRACT = {For almost a decade, Twitter use and its impact on students&rsquo; academic performance have been explored by many researchers. Despite growing scholarly interest, studies have been mostly quantitative in nature. The findings of previous studies are conflicting; thus, an in-depth study is needed to determine how and what impacts college students&rsquo; academic performance (i.e., GPA) when they spend time on Twitter. The purpose of this study was to understand the effects of Twitter use on college students&rsquo; academic performance. The present study shows that individual analysis techniques, such as quantitative or qualitative tools, are not enough to understand the underlying relationship. Therefore, a mixed-method approach (i.e., correlation and discourse analysis) was used to analyze the research data. Undergraduate students responded (N = 498) to a set of items along with some open-ended questions (n = 121). The results of this study indicate that how students use Twitter matters more than the amount of time they spend using it for their studies.},

  abstract={Social media use among students is increasing day by day, and so does its effects on students’ academic achievement (i.e., Grade Point Average). The relationship between students’ GPA and the use of social media (e.g., Twitter) is not straightforward, because of the hierarchical nature of the data. There is a gap in research that explores the relationship between students’ academic achievement considering hierarchical perspectives. This study attempts to find the relationship between students’ use of Twitter and their GPA. In addition, how their major is related to their use of Twitter. The results suggest that the relationship between Twitter use and students’ academic majors is related. Students from STEM majors have a positive effect than students from social sciences.},
