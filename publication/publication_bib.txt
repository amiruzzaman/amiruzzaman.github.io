Findings of this study suggest that most accidents occur in the dusk (i.e., between 6 and 7 pm), and on Fridays. Results also suggest that most accidents occurred in October, which is a popular month for tourism. These findings are consistent with social information and can help policymakers, residents, tourists, and other law enforcement agencies. This study can be extended to draw broader implications.",

  abstract={Identifying a user or a person through handwriting-data is a popular technique. Many researches have been done in this area most of which are image or pattern-based analysis. The accuracy level depends on the quality of the image or pattern. In this paper, we proposed user authentication system using an individual's pen tablet handwriting data. The proposed system is concerned with the numerical value of a person handwriting data getting from the digital pen and tablet device. Hence, user authentication through pen tablet data ensures more accuracy by working with user's real time handwritten data. In the proposed system, 24 persons writing samples(1262 .csv files and 23 class)are used for extracting features to identify a user based on their handwriting attributes. Six completely separated features are extracted after data analysis and pre-processing. The extracted features are mainly concerned with the vital attributes of a user's handwriting. The extracted features are used for classification. With this concern, we utilized different classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Random Forest (RF) classifier. From the implementation, different algorithms show different accuracy level. The testing accuracy rate of SVM, LR, LDA and RF is 87%, 85%, 76% and 77% respectively. The experimental analysis shows that we got more robust and satisfactory results which ensure the practicality of our system.},

  abstract={Activity identification based on machine learning for human computing aims to understand or capture the state of human behavior, its environment, and integrate user by exploiting distinct types of sensors to give adjustment to the exogenous computing system. The ascent of universal computing systems requires our environment a solid requirement for novel methodologies of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). The recognition of human activities, commonly known as HAR can play a vital task in this regard. HAR has an appealing use in the health-care system and monitoring of Daily Living Activities (DLA) of elderly people by offering the input for the development of more interactive and cognitive environments. This paper is presenting a model for the recognition of Human Activities. In this proposed model, the Enveloped Power Spectrum (EPS) is used for extracting impulse components of the signal, and the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used as a dimensionality reduction procedure to extract the discriminant features for human daily activity recognition. After completing EPS feature extraction techniques, LDA is performed on those extracted spectra for extracting features using the dimension reduction technique. Finally, the discriminant vocabulary vector is trained by the Multiclass Support Vector Machine (MCSVM) to classify human activities. For validating the proposed scheme, UCI-HAR datasets have been implemented which demonstrates higher recognition accuracy which has been acknowledged.},

ABSTRACT = {This article concerns smoke detection in the early stages of a fire. Using the computer-aided system, the efficient and early detection of smoke may stop a massive fire incident. Without considering the multiple moving objects on background and smoke particles analysis (i.e., pattern recognition), smoke detection models show suboptimal performance. To address this, this paper proposes a hybrid smoke segmentation and an efficient symmetrical simulation model of dynamic smoke to extract a smoke growth feature based on temporal frames from a video. In this model, smoke is segmented from the multi-moving object on the complex background using the Gaussian&rsquo;s Mixture Model (GMM) and HSV (hue-saturation-value) color segmentation to encounter the candidate smoke and non-smoke regions in the preprocessing stage. The preprocessed temporal frames with moving smoke are analyzed by the dynamic smoke growth analysis and spatial-temporal frame energy feature extraction model. In dynamic smoke growth analysis, the temporal frames are segmented in blocks and the smoke growth representations are formulated from corresponding blocks. Finally, the classifier was trained using the extracted features to classify and detect smoke using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) non-linear Gaussian kernel-based binary Support Vector Machine (SVM). For validating the proposed smoke detection model, multi-conditional video clips are used. The experimental results suggest that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using embedded sensors in smartphones and smartwatch has gained popularity in extensive applications in health care monitoring of elderly people, security purpose, robotics, monitoring employees in the industry, and others. However, human behavior analysis using the accelerometer and gyroscope data are typically grounded on supervised classification techniques, where models are showing sub-optimal performance for qualitative and quantitative features. Considering this factor, this paper proposes an efficient and reduce dimension feature extraction model for human activity recognition. In this feature extraction technique, the Enveloped Power Spectrum (EPS) is used for extracting impulse components of the signal using frequency domain analysis which is more robust and noise insensitive. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used as dimensionality reduction procedure to extract the minimum number of discriminant features from envelop spectrum for human activity recognition (HAR). The extracted features are used for human activity recognition using Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MCSVM). The proposed model was evaluated by using two benchmark datasets, i.e., the UCI-HAR and DU-MD datasets. This model is compared with other state-of-the-art methods and the model is outperformed.},

This paper presents a lens-based visual interaction technique, GTMapLens, to flexibly browse the geo-text data on a map. It allows users to perform dynamic focus+context exploration by using movable lenses to browse geographical regions, find locations of interest, and perform comparative and drill-down studies. Geo-text data is visualized in a way that users can easily perceive the underlying geospatial semantics along with lens moving. Based on a requirement analysis with a cohort of multidisciplinary domain experts, a set of lens interaction techniques are developed including keywords control, path management, context visualization, and snapshot anchors. They allow users to achieve a guided and controllable exploration of geo-text data. A hierarchical data model enables the interactive lens operations by accelerated data retrieval from a geo-text database. Evaluation with real-world datasets is presented to show the usability and effectiveness of GTMapLens.},

  abstract={Vision-based deep learning (DL) methods have made great progress in learning autonomous driving models from large-scale crowd-sourced video datasets. They are trained to predict instantaneous driving behaviors from video data captured by on-vehicle cameras. In this paper, we develop a geo-context aware visualization system for the study of Autonomous Driving Model (ADM) predictions together with large-scale ADM video data. The visual study is seamlessly integrated with the geographical environment by combining DL model performance with geospatial visualization techniques. Model performance measures can be studied together with a set of geospatial attributes over map views. Users can also discover and compare prediction behaviors of multiple DL models in both city-wide and street-level analysis, together with road images and video contents. Therefore, the system provides a new visual exploration platform for DL model designers in autonomous driving. Use cases and domain expert evaluation show the utility and effectiveness of the visualization system.},

  abstract={DBSCAN is a well-known clustering algorithm that is often used to find associations and structures in large spatial data. Due to its popularity, built-in functions for DBSCAN have been implemented on top of many different programming languages. Researchers and practitioners (i.e., data scientists) have been using these built-in functions to cluster and analyze a prolific area of research in data science. Due to the many implementations of DBSCAN and its utilization in many different languages, the output of each built-in DBSCAN function is assumed to be identical. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to evaluate the built-in functions of DBSCAN algorithms and to identify discrepancies in their output. The evidence from the study shows that there are some discrepancies and recommends caution in dealing with built-in functions.},

  abstract={Supply chains in the modern era have developed into very complex value networks and have become a critical source of competitive advantage. Verifying the origin of raw materials and maintaining visibility of goods and merchandise as they move through the value chain network is difficult. The Internet of Things (IoT) application may assist businesses in observing, tracking, and monitoring items, activities, and processes inside their value chain networks. Both blockchain and Internet of Things technologies have the potential to accelerate the implementation of Industry 4.0 and transform foreign trade procedures. Integrated technology utilization may be a component of the answer to this future. This paper’s contribution is to demonstrate how the marriage of Blockchain technology with IoT infrastructure may simplify and enhance contemporary supply chains in a variety of ways. Such as increasing scalability, security, immutability, and auditing, as well as information flows, traceability, and interoperability, and quality, using Ping Asset devices and Chainlink, and so setting the groundwork for future research projects.},

Data-driven visualizations have yet to be fully incorporated into the flight training process. The Airman Visual Evaluation System (AVES) applies a data-driven approach to support airman certification training by processing data recorded from common avionics systems such as the Garmin G1000. Maneuvers, e.g. steep turns, are decomposed into a hierarchical definition including task, sub-task, and related components according to available data. Each level in the hierarchy defines a related event detectable within the data. At the top-level of the hierarchy are points where an instructor may wish to review with a student while lower levels of the hierarchy support the review with additional information. Performance measurements are associated with each event to be captured from the data. Visual analytics approaches are applied to convey the events and related performance information including 2D and 3D views of flight replay, event timelines, performance related visualizations. The visualizations are provided in an interactive application to convey the information. User studies are conducted to identify and measure value within airman certification programs. }

ABSTRACT = {For almost a decade, Twitter use and its impact on students&rsquo; academic performance have been explored by many researchers. Despite growing scholarly interest, studies have been mostly quantitative in nature. The findings of previous studies are conflicting; thus, an in-depth study is needed to determine how and what impacts college students&rsquo; academic performance (i.e., GPA) when they spend time on Twitter. The purpose of this study was to understand the effects of Twitter use on college students&rsquo; academic performance. The present study shows that individual analysis techniques, such as quantitative or qualitative tools, are not enough to understand the underlying relationship. Therefore, a mixed-method approach (i.e., correlation and discourse analysis) was used to analyze the research data. Undergraduate students responded (N = 498) to a set of items along with some open-ended questions (n = 121). The results of this study indicate that how students use Twitter matters more than the amount of time they spend using it for their studies.},

The relationship between students’ GPA and the use of social media (e.g., Twitter) is not straightforward, because of the hierarchical nature of the data. There is a gap in research that explores the relationship between students’ academic achievement considering hierarchical perspectives. This study attempts to find the relationship between students’ use of Twitter and their GPA. In addition, how their major is related to their use of Twitter. The results suggest that the relationship between Twitter use and students’ academic majors is related. Students from STEM majors have a positive effect than students from social sciences.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this research is to discuss the groundwork of building an Islamic Banking Document Screening Prototype based on a serverless architecture framework. This research first forms an algorithm for document matching based Vector Space Model (VCM) and adopts Levenshtein Distance for similarity setting. Product proposals will become a query, and policy documents by the central bank will be a corpus or database for document matching. Both the query and corpus went through preprocessing stage prior to similarity analysis. One set of queries with two sets of corpora is tested in this research to compare similarity values. Finally, a prototype of Shariah Document Screening is built based on a serverless architecture framework and ReactJS interface. This research is the first attempt to introduce a Shariah document screening prototype based on a serverless architecture technology that would be useful to the Islamic financial industry towards achieving a Shariah-compliant business. Given the development of Fintech, the output of this research study would be a complement to the existing Fintech applications, which focus on ensuring the Islamic nature of the businesses.},

    abstract = "{Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) has risen to prominence as one of the decade’s most disruptive technologies. It has the potential to fundamentally alter how individuals do business, monitor their goods, and handle their personal data. For decades, trade finance has been experiencing a digital revolution. It is, however, the outcome of an inability to digitize and streamline corporate operations. As a result, trade finance is still primarily a paper-based and labor-intensive enterprise. Additionally, costs continue to be persistently high. This is due in part to rising regulatory constraints. However, the development of new technologies such as blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) has increased the pace of this digital transformation. Numerous distributed ledger technology (DLT) initiatives have sprouted up to assist in connecting diverse key parties and improving trade finance and supply chain finance operations. The platforms must be assessed and rigorously studied to determine their applicability, resilience, and long-term viability. In this article, we conducted a survey of various top DLT platforms for Trade Finance and assessed their capabilities using a qualitative criteria. The comparative analysis offered in this article will assist in selecting the optimal platform for the job.}",

abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The House Price Index (HPI) is commonly used to estimate the changes in housing prices. The sale price of the house is correlated with many other factors like geographical location, size of the house, age of the house, the area and population of the neighborhood etc. There has been a considerably large number of datasets released in the literature of various locations to explore the correlation of the sale price of houses with their corresponding features. However, all the features don’t affect the sale price in equal proportion. Some features strongly correlate with each other and, while some features don’t carry any importance or are probably redundant. As a result, to explore various impacts of features on sales prices, we performed a detailed data analysis on the original house dataset. This report also comprehensively validates multiple steps of data analysis with supporting statistics and visualizations to provide an optimistic result of various features and their impact on the sales price of houses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, journal={Research Briefs on Information and Communication Technology Evolution },

abstract = {Detection of diseases in plants at an early stage is crucial to achieving high yields, preserving crop quality, and effective disease management. Existing research focuses mostly on leaf disease detection, despite the fact that disease may develop everywhere on the plant. We developed a new dataset using the PlantVillage dataset and other online sources. We used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, Alexnet and MobileNet to analyze and evaluate the performance of the models on the new dataset (i.e., consists of over 50,000 images). The models were trained on the new dataset for 100 epochs. MobileNet outperformed the other two models, attaining 99.69\% training accuracy, 94.37\% validation accuracy, 96\% average precision, 96\% recall, and an F1-score. The MobileNet model predicted diseases that affect portions of the plant other than the leaf better. This work demonstrates detecting plant disease and provides a feasible technique for enhancing crop management.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a framework to convert American Sign Language (ASL) to English and English to ASL. Within this framework, we use a deep learning model along with the rolling average prediction that captures image frames from videos and classifies the signs from the image frames. The classified frames are then used to construct ASL words and sentences to support people with hearing impairments. We also use the same deep learning model to capture signs from the people with deaf symptoms and convert them into ASL words and English sentences. Based on this framework, we developed a web-based tool to use in real-life application and we also present the tool as a proof of concept. With the evaluation, we found that the deep learning model converts the image signs into ASL words and sentences with high accuracy. The tool was also found to be very useful for people with hearing impairment and deaf symptoms. The main contribution of this work is the design of a system to convert ASL to English and vice versa.},

  journal = {SN Computer Science},
  volume = {6},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Yield estimation and identifying the growth stages of roses greatly depend on the automatic detection of roses in orchards. YOLO is well known for its high accuracy and real-time performance among the deep learning-based object detection techniques. In our study, we proposed a model based on YOLOv8 and DNN that uses detection, localization, and classification to grade rose quality. YOLOv8 was used to localize the roses with bounding boxes. The regions of interest are detected by YOLOv8 and cropped from the source images by the bounding boxes and fed into deep learning model for classifying roses according to growth stages, thus, the freshness level is ultimately graded. We used YOLOv8 for detection and DNN for classification. We proposed two different deep learning models for the classification task. The first was a lightweight CNN model which achieved a faster speed in grading roses, while the second was a fine-tuned MobileNet model which achieved a higher accuracy. We have also collected a new dataset that contained variety, complex backgrounds, overlapping roses etc. Numerous deep learning models were exploited in this work, including ResNet50, VGG19, MobileNet, NASNetMobile for comparison purpose. Comparing with these models, proposed CNN and fine-tuned MobileNet had simple and light-weight structure, better accuracy and our method could fulfill the real-time requirements. In our proposed method, YOLOv8 was used to detect roses. Then after applying fine-tuning, fine-tuned MobileNet achieved remarkable accuracy in classifying roses. The study may give technological references for developing rose harvesting robots and estimating orchard yields.},

  abstract = { Pilot shortages are predicted to increase over the next decades, resulting in a need to increase the number of qualified pilots. A challenge in meeting this need is maintaining the quality of the training while increasing the throughput. Data-driven approaches, supported by visual analytics techniques, offer a means to meet this challenge and possibly reduce training time and/or improve quality. In this study, we examine the Airman Certification Standards (ACS) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) performance maneuvers relevant to initial pilot training. Decomposition methods are applied to the maneuver to establish analyzable components and remove time-related variability. This representation supports a general comparability of maneuver instances, allowing quantification of pilot improvements as well as more direct comparability to gold standards. The decomposition also increases relevance for instructional feedback against individual segments reflecting pilot considerations during the maneuver. Visualizations are applied to further facilitate student-instructor discussion and actionable student feedback. A volume of actual training data is analyzed and explored through user evaluation with aviation experts and students to validate technique applicability. }

  abstract={One of the widening perils in network security is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. This paper presents an enhanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) through the proposal of an enhanced version of the long short-term memory (LSTM) model to detect DDoS attacks using honeypot-generated data. The proposed model aggregates the Conv1D, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), and dropout layers to extract temporal and spatial features from IoT traffic effectively. We tested the efficacy of the proposed system on a real-world IoT-DH dataset, which showed a remarkable accuracy of 99.41{\%}, with an AUC score of 0.9999. A comparative analysis with other baseline models, such as LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), proved that enhanced LSTM outperformed the other models. This indicates the robustness of the proposed model in correctly detecting DDoS attacks with high generalization capability for unseen traffic data. The contribution of this paper will be an addition to the deep learning techniques applied for the solution of intrusion detection systems (IDS), which will also allow the building and implementation of more efficient security mechanisms in IoT environments.},

Paying attention to class lectures and following instructions for different steps to solve a problem are the keys to success in learning mathematical concepts. However, deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) students have challenges in focusing on their teacher’s mouths to lipread or depend on an interpreter’s sign language. Visualization is important in learning as it enhances attention and keeps students focused on a subject. Interactive learning or a hands-on approach can help learners engage in a topic and provide an opportunity to better understand a concept. Combining these two techniques (i.e., visualization and interactive learning), we present an interactive number line (INL) tool to help DHH students understand mathematical concepts such as mean, median, mode, and range. This tool has proven to be useful for visual learning and/or for new learners as it helps provide an activity-based learning environment and feedback.},

  abstract={Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision and image understanding, with the goal of identifying and localizing objects of interest within an image while assigning them corresponding class labels. Traditional methods, which relied on handcrafted features and shallow models, struggled with complex visual data and showed limited performance. These methods combined low-level features with contextual information and lacked the ability to capture high-level semantics. Deep learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), addressed these limitations by automatically learning rich, hierarchical features directly from data. These features include both semantic and high-level representations essential for accurate object detection. This paper reviews object detection frameworks, starting with classical computer vision methods. We categorize object detection approaches into two groups: (1) classical computer vision techniques and (2) CNN-based detectors. We compare major CNN models, discussing their strengths and limitations. In conclusion, this review highlights the significant advancements in object detection through deep learning and identifies key areas for further research to improve performance.},
