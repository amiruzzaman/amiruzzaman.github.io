I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at West Chester University. Prior to joining WCU, I worked as a software developer for almost 10 years for several companies. I have also held the position of Assistant Professor at Kent State University.

I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from National University. I have earned four Master's degrees: an M.S. in Computer Engineering from Sejong University in 2008, an M.S. in Computer Science from Kent State University (partly at Korea University) in 2011, an M.S. in Technology from Kent State University in 2015, and an M.S. in Cybersecurity from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2023. I also hold three Ph.D. degrees from Kent State University: in Mathematics Education (2016), Evaluation and Measurement (2019), and Computer Science (2021).

In the past, I have worked as a Research Assistant at Sejong University and Korea University, and had the opportunity to teach at both National University and Korea University. My research interests include Visual Analytics of urban data, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Hiding.
