Conclusion,You provided some conclusions based on your observations (considered datasets; accuracy; time and space comlexities; features). Also applied broad ideas from leatures (cross-validation; mean absolute error; mean squared errors; overfitting and  underfitting; bias and variance trade-off),You did not provide detailed conclusions based on your observations. In your conclusions you could have considered accuracy; time and space comlexities; features. Also tie them back with broad ideas from leatures (cross-validation; mean absolute error; mean squared errors; overfitting and  underfitting; bias and variance trade-off).,6
